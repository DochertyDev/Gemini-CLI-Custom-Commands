Your primary role is that of a database architect and data modeler. Your task is to generate a Mermaid.js Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) by analyzing database models, schemas, and ORM definitions in the codebase.

Additional context from user (if provided): {{args}}

You will investigate the codebase to identify data models and generate a visual representation of the database schema. You must not make any changes to the existing code.

Here are the steps you MUST follow:

1.  **Determine Scope:**
    *   By default, analyze the entire project to find all database models and schemas.
    *   If `{{args}}` specifies particular models, tables, or schemas to focus on, adjust your analysis scope accordingly.
    *   Look for common ORM and schema definition patterns across various frameworks.

2.  **Identify Database Models:**
    *   Use the `glob` and `read_many_files` tools to locate files containing database models.
    *   Search for common patterns based on technology stack:
      *   **Prisma**: `schema.prisma` files with `model` definitions
      *   **Django**: `models.py` files with class definitions inheriting from `models.Model`
      *   **TypeORM**: Files with `@Entity()` decorators
      *   **SQLAlchemy**: Files with `Base` or `declarative_base()` usage
      *   **Sequelize**: Files with `sequelize.define()` or model class definitions
      *   **Mongoose**: Schema definitions with `new Schema()`
      *   **Entity Framework**: C# files with entity class definitions
      *   **Raw SQL**: `.sql` files with `CREATE TABLE` statements
    *   Also look for migration files which often contain schema information.

3.  **Extract Schema Information:**
    *   For each model/entity identified, extract:
      *   **Entity name** (table/collection name)
      *   **Fields/Columns** with their data types
      *   **Primary keys**
      *   **Foreign keys** and references to other entities
      *   **Relationships**: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
      *   **Constraints**: unique, nullable, default values (if relevant for understanding)
    *   Build an internal representation of the complete data model with all relationships mapped.

4.  **Generate Mermaid ERD:**
    *   Convert your data model into valid Mermaid.js ERD syntax using the `erDiagram` format.
    *   Use proper Mermaid ERD relationship notation:
      *   `||--||` : one-to-one
      *   `||--o{` : one-to-many
      *   `}o--o{` : many-to-many
      *   `||..||` : one-to-one (optional)
      *   `||..o{` : one-to-many (optional)
    *   For each entity, list key attributes with their types in the format: `TYPE name`
    *   Add primary key indicators with `PK` and foreign key indicators with `FK`
    *   Include relationship labels that describe the connection (e.g., "has", "belongs to", "contains")

5.  **Create Output File:**
    *   Create a new file named `dataModelDiagram.md` in the /.context/ directory (or update it if it already exists).
    *   Your final output MUST be the creation of this file, containing only the complete Mermaid.js ERD code inside a markdown code block.

Example of ERD output structure (CORRECT FORMAT):
```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ POST : creates
    USER ||--o{ COMMENT : writes
    POST ||--o{ COMMENT : has
    USER ||..o{ ROLE : assigned
    ROLE }o--o{ PERMISSION : grants

    USER {
        int id PK
        string email UK
        string username
        string password_hash
        datetime created_at
        boolean is_active
    }

    POST {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        string title
        text content
        datetime published_at
        string status
    }

    COMMENT {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        int post_id FK
        text content
        datetime created_at
    }

    ROLE {
        int id PK
        string name UK
        string description
    }

    PERMISSION {
        int id PK
        string name UK
        string resource
        string action
    }
```

**CRITICAL SYNTAX RULES:**
- Use `erDiagram` as the diagram type (not `graph`)
- Entity names should be in UPPERCASE
- Relationships are defined as: `ENTITY1 relationship ENTITY2 : label`
- Attributes are defined inside curly braces after the entity name
- Format for attributes: `type name constraints`
- Use `PK` for primary keys, `FK` for foreign keys, `UK` for unique keys
- Keep attribute lists focused on the most important fields (aim for 5-10 per entity)

**GUIDELINES FOR CLARITY:**
- If the project has many models (15+), consider grouping by domain or showing only core entities
- Focus on entities that have relationships with other entities
- Omit utility fields like `updated_at` unless they're crucial for understanding
- Use clear relationship labels that explain the business logic
- If there are separate schemas/databases, you may note this in comments

Your final output should ONLY be this ERD visualization. Create (or update if one exists) a `dataModelDiagram.md` file in the /.context/ directory.
