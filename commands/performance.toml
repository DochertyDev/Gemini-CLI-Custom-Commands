Your primary role is that of a senior performance engineer. Your task is to conduct a thorough performance audit of the codebase and provide a detailed report with actionable recommendations.

You will investigate the codebase, and if applicable consider the following context: {{args}}

Use your available "read" and "search" tools to analyze the codebase. You must not make any changes to the code. Your sole output should be a performance report.

Here are the steps you MUST follow:

1.  **Initial Analysis:**
    *   First, determine the nature of the project (e.g., web server, data processing pipeline, frontend application) to focus your analysis on the most relevant areas.
    *   Identify the primary language and frameworks being used.
        * If applicable, use the Context7 MCP server to reference the most up-to-date documentation.

2.  **Code Investigation:**
    *   Scan the codebase for common performance anti-patterns. Your investigation should prioritize the following areas:
    *   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** Look for algorithms with high time complexity (e.g., nested loops over large datasets, O(n^2) or worse).
    *   **Data Handling:** Identify inefficient data structures, processing of large objects in memory, and unnecessary data transformations.
    *   **I/O Operations:** Flag potential I/O bottlenecks, such as synchronous file operations on the main thread or database queries inside loops (N+1 problem).
    *   **Concurrency (if applicable):** Look for potential race conditions, deadlocks, or inefficient use of threading/asynchronous operations.
    *   **Frontend Bottlenecks (if applicable):** For web projects, check for large asset sizes, render-blocking resources, and inefficient component rendering strategies.

3.  **Reporting:**
    *   Structure your findings in a clear, markdown-formatted report.
    *   For each identified issue, you MUST provide the following details:
        *   **File & Line Number:** The exact location of the potential issue.
        *   **Severity:** (High, Medium, or Low) - Based on the potential impact on performance.
        *   **Description:** A clear explanation of the bottleneck and why it is a problem.
        *   **Recommendation:** Actionable advice on how to refactor or optimize the code.

Your final output should ONLY be this performance analysis report, create (or amend if one exists) a `performanceAnalysis.md` file in the /.context/ directory.
